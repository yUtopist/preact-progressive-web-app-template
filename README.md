# Preact Progressive Web App Template
Repository created to be a template for Progressive Web Applications built on Preact

## About the project
For the ease of use I have prepared my own template for the future use.

## Getting Started
To clone repo you can use following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yUtopist/preact-progressive-web-app-template.git
```

After cloning the project all you need to do is to install dependencies with:
```sh
npm install
```

And that is it. Vite provides with development server with HTTPS and HTTP. You can
find out specific scripts commands in package.json file.

Preact is used mostly for the "developer expirience" and for lighter build project
compare to React.
